{"repl_description":"A TypeScript-based chatbot assistant that enables real-time communication through WebSocket connections and integrates with the Claude API for advanced language processing and computer control capabilities. The system features a modular architecture with tool execution capabilities, system configuration management, and a role-based access control system for managing tool permissions, including natural language command interpretation and validation for computer control operations.\n\nThe platform includes a custom tool creation interface for dynamic registration and management of new tools, supported by analytics and monitoring capabilities. The analytics system tracks tool execution history, performance metrics, and usage patterns through PostgreSQL integration, while the permission management interface enables configuration of role-based access and default permissions.\n\nTech Stack:\n• TypeScript\n• WebSocket for real-time communication\n• Claude API integration\n• PostgreSQL database\n• Component-based UI architecture\n• Tool execution framework with RBAC\n• Form validation system\n• Tool registration interface\n• Analytics components\n• Permission management system\n• Computer control interface","repl_description_state":"DESCRIPTION_APPROVED","repl_stack":"FULLSTACK_JS"}
